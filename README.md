# An analysis of kickstarter campaigns
**This analysis was made with primarily focus on theater kickstarter campaigns**

## Objective

Perform analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends, evaluate and inform the client if a Kickstarter project is viable.   

## Findings
- While soting out the data down for the outcome of the parent category of the kickstarter data we are able to see that not only there has been a lot of campaigns for this category but actually it is one of the most successful in fullfilling their goals.

- Further narrowing the information to country (US) and for theater we can see that the story repeats itself, it has a lot successful campaigns, which are good news!

- Investigating a little further down we are able to see that from all the theater campaigns a good amount (671) are plays, and the 61.4% of those were successful.

- Now talking a little about the time, it was also investigated when the campaign should be held and how long it should last, **as it can determine its success or failure**. The main tendency throughout the years is that most of the successful campaigns were hold may and june so it is recommended to use this time period to hold the kickstarter campaign for a theater related event.

- Finally using central tendency tools in specific data from the US, it can be determined that the Goal for the campaign must not be over 5000 US dollars but is is recommended for it to be about 3000 US dollars as it it both the median of all successful campaigns and for the successful pledged. Also a box chart was made to analyze the musicals in GB as they can be helpful as a comparison with our main focus, also as to use as a reference for future projects in this region. In the chart we can see how the information is a little skewed to the right as the mean is higher than the median which is explained by two points considered outliers which should not be considered for the anaylisis since one was to build a theater and the other was cancelled. The same can be said for the pledged category as the outlier is for the construction of a theater. With the other data now we can determine that most of the campaigns goals are way over the actually pledged so now we can decide a viable and real goal that can be reached, one taht at least 75% of all pledged data says that can be achieved something about $1,500

## Conclusion
After all the investigation and findings provided, for a theater kickstarter campaign to be successful it is assumed that the US is a great region to have this project, as many have been successful before, but not only with stuff related to theater like building it but also for plays as 61% of all play's campaigns have been successful. From May to June is the time period which is the most successful for funding the play ** it is heavily recommended to use this time.** Finally a real achievable goal for a musical in GB as it was another interest of the client is $1,500 as 75% of all the musicals pledged at least this amount.
